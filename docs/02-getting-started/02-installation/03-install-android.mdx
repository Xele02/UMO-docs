  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="method2" label="Method 2">
    Use a PC to act as a download server. The game will connect to it to get the files. Once it's done, you don't need the server anymore.

## Installation

### Install the game

Install the game apk on your Android device. Your device may require you to allow the installation of untrusted apks.

### Install the game data

<Tabs groupId="methods">
  <TabItem value="method1" label="Method 1" default>
* Extract and copy the data & mx folders directly to your device at this location: Android/data/com.UtaMacrossOffline.UtaMacrossOffline/files/
![image](https://github.com/Xele02/UMO/assets/2817631/1219fe8c-7c7a-43b6-b742-402a7c24aac4)

:::warning
You may not be able to use this method on Android 11 and above because the data folder is locked. If this is the case, try `Method 2` or `Method 3`.
:::
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="method2" label="Method 2">
* **On your PC**:
  * Extract the game data dump called UtaMacrossDataArchive.zip
  * Extract the files from UtaMacrossDataArchivePCPatch.zip and copy the db folder into the data folder of the game data dump, so you have the android and db folders as follows:  
![image](https://github.com/Xele02/UMO/assets/2817631/1035d499-624c-4f00-809b-51f3ed9a363d)
  * Extract the UMO Server zip file.
  * Run the UMOServer executable.
  * In the input box at the top of the UMOServer window, input the file path where you put the game data (the folder containing the android & db folders).
Use this format: `drive letter`:/`folder name`/data (See the next screenshot below for an example)
  * Click the Start Server button. On Windows, you may need to accept the firewall security. (The server uses port 8000, set server discovery by broadcast to use port 8001).  
![image](https://github.com/Xele02/UMO/assets/2817631/b48f62f3-de5b-4493-b2e5-3bc2c8d1ee15)
  * The log underneath should display 'Ready'.
* **On your Android device** :
  * Start the game. The first time you run the game, it will need to download the resource files from the data dump that you downloaded and extracted to your PC.
A pop-up will open telling you to run the server.
  * **Your Android device and the server (your PC) should be on the same local network.** If they are, your device should auto-detect the server and download the data.
Once the download is finished and the main screen appears, you can close the server.
  * If the game doesn't find the server, click the cancel button and enter the local IP of the PC running the server.
  * The game can freeze during download, just restart it.

&nbsp;
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="method3" label="Method 3">
  * Start the game. The first time you run the game, it will need to download the resource files.
  * When the popup telling you to run the server, click on the cancel button.
  * Enter in the input text box in place of 0.0.0.0 this url : `umo.xele.org` and validate the popup. The data will start to download.
  * Redo it everytime the game ask for it.
  * The game can freeze during download, just restart it.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting :
* The game might crash or stuff might display incorrectly because there was an error when downloading the data dump file. 
If you used an encrypted version of the data, you can force a recheck of the files by tapping on the game controller icon on the title screen, 
and selecting the option to force recheck and start the game. It will recheck all files (which takes a long time). If you use the decrypted version of the data, 
all the files will be redownloaded. This is because the game expects the encrypted data for data comparison. This will be fixed at a later date.
